                    There’s no question that software programming is a 
                    hot career right now. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
                     projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018
                    to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all
                    occupations. What’s more, the median annual pay for a software
                    programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the
                    median pay for all U.S. workers.
                    Not all programming jobs are the same, however.
                    Different roles, companies, and types of software
                    require knowing and understanding different
                    programming languages—and it’s often beneficial
                    to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the
                    field of software programming can be a daunting
                    experience, especially for professionals with no prior
                    programming experience.

                     computer programming language, any of various languages
                     for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a
                     digital computer. Such instructions can be executed
                     directly when they are in the computer
                     manufacturer-specific numerical form known
                     as machine language, after a simple substitution
                     process when expressed in a corresponding assembly
                     language, or after translation from some
                     higher-level” language. Although there are many
                     computer languages, relatively few are widely used.
